# Shryan

<a style="color: cornflowerblue;">Shryan is not a language. It is an <i>abstraction of thought.</i> </a>

<a style="color: olive;">Shryan is a portmanteau of *shrei* and *yanre*, which means *intelligent words* in Shryan.</a>

## Guiding Thoughts

In an era where information is increasingly the powerhouse of the world, ironically information is harder to communicate across than ever. Great specialization in today's society means that a lot of what we know is complicated; but complex ideas are often synonymous to long passages of convoluted text. This renders communication of these ideas slow and difficult.

Our society has recognized this problem and responded in two ways: training people to express themselves better and training people to learn quickly. The former gives the skill to convey abstractions with clarity, while the latter builds the intelligence to comprehend and absorb them well.

However, perhaps there is a part to the communication process which is often overlooked (and maybe rightfully so) - the language itself. Offhand, inventing a new language for better communication sounds like a long detour that isn't guaranteed to work. Not only does a new language take a lot of time to learn, but also who is to say that this novel language will be inherently better at communicating human ideas than anything which we already have and tested?

If you did take a second to let that last sentence sink in - congratulations! You have discovered that English is surprisingly bad at delivering complex sentences. Notice that when we think, however, even convoluted ideas seem to be represented in a simple manner. 

Therefore, the following are the natural guiding questions behind Shryan's creation:

<div width="100%" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Can we inject the simplicity of thought into a language?</div>

<div width="100%" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Can a language be not only powerful, but also lightweight and easy to learn?</div>

<div width="100%" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">How can we condense information in a language, while still maintaining interpretability?</div>



### Problems with Existing Languages

* Difficult learning
  * Irregularities
* Redundant grammar
* Information sparse
* Not accurate and specific enough
* Incapable of grasping with complex entities
* Not good enough at communicating emotional nuances



**These mean that ironically, a language instead becomes a barrier to communication **

* Lack of a 'global language'
* Misunderstanding
* Difficulty in communicating across abstract, complex ideas



### The *Shryan* Vision

**To create a common language that is both lightweight, nuanced and concise, so that in an increasingly global world we can express the most complex information in the fewest syllables, with little ambiguity and irregularities.**



### Mission Statement

**Design an artificial language built to be concise, precise and scalable.**

**Conciseness** means that no information is repeated twice. What can be inferred from other parts of the sentence should be omitted.

Grammatically, it also means that there should be no irregularities and everything should be logical. It should also require minimal memorization. This makes the language easy to learn.

*Counter examples*: 

**Preciseness** means that there should be no ambiguities, either in word meaning or sentence structure. Shryan mainly concerns itself with syntactical ambiguities, but semantic ambiguities may also be resolved via EMAPSI.

*Counter examples:* 

* -| Forcing everyone together |-  vs  -| Forcing everyone | together |- <a style="color: grey">Solved by EMAPSI</a>
* -| Consequential | and | inconsequential temporal |- vs -| Consequential and inconsequential | temporal |- <a style="color: grey">Solved under the nesting sentence structures page</a>
* -| I greeted | my brother drinking wine |- vs -| I greeted | my brother | drinking wine |- <a style="color: grey">Solved by EMAPSI</a>
* -| I saw someone on the | hill with a telescope. |- vs -| I saw someone | on the hill | with a telescope. |- <a style="color: grey">Solved by EMAPSI</a>
* -| I ate the | cookies on the couch |- vs -| I ate | the cookies | on the couch |- <a style="color: grey">Solved by EMAPSI</a>
* To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license. <a style="color: grey">Solved under the nesting sentence structures page</a>

**Scalability** means that although the base grammar of a language is simple to pick up, the language should simultaneously support complex semantic structures and subtle differences in ideas. It should allow speakers to expand sentences and constructions, easily expressing and understanding complex abstractions, relationships and emotions.

Another way to look at this is that sentence complexity is directly proportional to information density, which argues for the propriety of the term '*scalability*'.

*Counter examples:*

**Altogether, a language that is precise and scalable while concise should be our best shot at directly communicating ideas. Due to its concise grammar, regular rules and well-defined structure, it should be easy to pick up and comprehend. Interpretability is also guaranteed by preciseness, as it makes sure what you hear is what you should understand.**



### Existing Artificial Languages of Similar Aims

#### Esperanto

Pros:

* Easy to learn (4x-10x faster than natural languages)
* Good community, culture & history

Cons:

* Non-standard characters
* Phonetic confusion between closely-related important words
  * E.g. In Esperanto, all the question words are two-syllable words, and the stressed syllable is the same in every word! Kio, Kiel, Kiam, Kiu, Kia, Kiom, Kies, etc.
* Lack of nuance to express suble ideas
  * E.g. In English, we have dozens of ways to alter verb tense, in order to convey additional implications in a statement. *I went to the store* is different from *I was going to the store*, and different from *I had been going to the store*, but in Esperanto, they're all said with the same simple past tense.
* Not regular enough
* Not linguistically neutral enough



#### Ithkuil

Pros

* Really semantically precise
* Apt at expressing philosophical ideas in a concise way
* 'Overtly expresses deeper aspects of human cognition' *as per website*

Cons

* Not intended for daily communication
* Extensive grammar sacrifices accessibility for semantic accuracy
* Long time to write and understand



#### Lojban

Pros

* Really logical
* Simplified tenses
* Emotional modifiers

Cons

* Too rigid to be a natural language
* Some unnatural grammatical constructs make it hard to learn and adapt to
* Some parts of it overcomplicated for the sake of logic
* Not semantically nuanced enough



## Shryan

This grammar presents Shryan in 2 sections. The first, more generic, section is called Shryan Longre. The second, more advanced section, is called Shryan Fei.

In case you don't already know, ***long*** denotes the state of being general, and ***fei*** is the adjective for advanced. Why is it ***longre*** but not ***long***? Read to find out!

### Pronunciation

In Shryan, all words are pronounced as they are written and written as they are pronounced. The stress almost always falls on the penultimte syllable.

### A note on fixed endings <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>VIP</sup></a>

To maintain greater interpretability, Shryan is designed so that certain parts of speech can only take certain endings. These are summarized in the table below:

| Part of Speech |                 Ending                  |
| :------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
|      Verb      |                ***-o***                 |
|      Noun      | ***-i*** / ***-u*** / ***-consonants*** |
|   Adjective    |          ***-ei*** / ***-e***           |
|     Adverb     |         ***-xi*** / ***-xhi***          |
|    Pronoun     |                ***-a***                 |



### Verbs

Let us be first introduced to a very import verb - the verb to-be, translated as ***fo*** in Shryan.

Note that in Shryan, tenses are not generally used. Instead, time specifiers must be employed and the tense inferred. This encourages preciseness as well as maintaining conciseness: it is concise because what can be inferred from the time setting does not need to be repeated in the inflection of the verb; and it is precise as the speaker is forced to provide a specification.



#### Time specifiers <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>VIP</sup></a>

Present continuous: ***jinan***

Present completion: ***jitun***

Near-past continuous: ***konan***

Near-past completion: ***kotun***

Far-past continuous: ***yanan***

Far-past completion: ***yatun***

A missing time specifier denotes a sense of timelessness, which isn't necessarily useless. Conventionally, this timelessness translates to the present tense in English.

Moreover, the absence of a clear subject also denotes that a verb is either impersonal or in the infinitive. These two meanings are not so different: consider 'one runs' vs 'to run'. There is a sense in which they are quite similar.



#### Sentence order

Sentence order matters in Shryan!! Consider the following examples. ***Oga*** means I or me, by the way.

***Yanan fo oga*** = There was once me

***Oga yanan fo*** = I was once

In general, verbs used at the start of a sentence denotes an impersonal usage: i.e. 'there is/are', 'it seems', 'it is deemed' etc. This is because the word order in Shryan is subject-verb-object, thus a missing subject denotes an impersonal tone.



#### Passives

Add ***-lh***.

Agency is expressed by ***bek***.



#### Participles

Shryan supports a multitude of participles.

Present active: ***-tsei***

Present passive: ***-lei***

<!--Verbs: -o-->

​	<!--Optional tenses & personal endings-->

​	<!--Passive-->

​	<!--Imperative: EMAPSI--> <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>NEW</sup></a>

Add ***-mei***

**Elemental**: an elephant -> with an elephant

Add ***-sei***

**Similar**: an elephant -> like an elephant

Add ***-re***

**Dissimilar**: an elephant -> unlike an elephant, away from an elephant

Add ***-fe***



#### Destinative

The destinative is the form of a noun that denotes a state / object to be reached. E.g. Giving money *to someone*, or think of concept A as *concept B*.

It is denoted by adding the suffix ***-(a)kid***.

<!--Nouns: -i -u -consonants-->

## Shryan Fei

### EMAPSI <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>NEW</sup></a> <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>VIP</sup></a>

EMAPSI is probably the most important piece of Shryan grammar. It extends Shryan Fei to acquire extraordinary descriptive power. Essentially, EMAPSI tells you how to add '*packages*' to any word in the Shryan dictionary.

[Emotion] + [Modifiers] + [Actions] + [Parents] + [Self] + [Inflection]

Multiple EMAPSI elements can be joined together.

#### Tones

Affirmative

> cra

Negative

> pes

Non-definitive (when used in front of noun acts like Eng 'a')

> sei

Definitive (when used in front of noun acts like Eng 'a')

> teg

Commanding

> jos

Happiness

> lin

Sorrow

> rai

Anger

> fol

Fear

> ssa

Disgust

> tua

Surprise

> neta

Contempt

> dun

Respect

> chein

Desire

> ta

Guilt

> lor

Desperation (can also act as a heightener, expressing stronger emotions)

> han

Trust

> dit

Mistrust

> leit

Anxiety

> vy

Empathy

> co

Solitude

> ryn

Awe

> ros

#### Modifiers

* Modifies the word it is attached to by offering additional information
* This can include adjectives, adjectival nouns, etc. but not participles. This belongs to actions

#### Actions

* Mainly participles

#### Parents

* Expresses any sense of hierarchical dominance / enclosure: e.g. spatial location,temporal location, type, species



#### EMAPSI Pronunciation

The general convention is to stress each component of EMAPSI like a single word to aid interpretability. So all the tones in a word will be stressed independently, followed by independent stressing of all the modifiers combined, and so on. Obvious self and inflection are essentially one word so you wouldn't stress them separately.



#### Examples

Non-delimited: *yanan fo rynraiqhisireporotseilavumeikrondu.*

Delimited: yanan fo ryn-rai'qhisi-re'poro-tsei'lavu-mei'krondu.

Translation: There was once a dimming, golden sunset by the sea that evoked sorrow and solitude in me.



### Logic

#### A discussion surrounding *and*

'And' is widespread in English as a conjunction to connect multiple entities into one, such as the 'bread and wine and water'. In Shryan, this simple use of 'and' is translated as ***lo***.

E.g. ***Cuatis lo suatis*** = tents and portaledges

However, oftentimes 'and' can also be used to express one action happening after the other, as in 'I went down the stairs and fell'. We might say that they have a *temporal correspondence* - I first went down the stairs, then I fell. Moreover, in this case, the two clauses have a *consequential temporal relationship*. Falling seem to entail naturally from me going down the stairs.

Contrast a *consequential temporal relationship* with an *inconsequential temporal relationship*, for instance, 'I did my homework and washed the dishes'. Washing the dishes and doing my homework do not seem to have any correlation with each other; it just so happens that I did my homework first, then washed the dishes.

Thus in fact, we can separate the meaning of 'and' into three subcategories:

| **Simple Relational** | **Consequential temporal** | **Inconsequential temporal** |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 'Rice and noodles' *or*<br/> 'I laughed and cried' | 'I looked at him and wept' | 'I slept and ate' |
| Combines multiple entities into one *or*<br/>Creates a non-temporal list of things<br/>I.e. I *laughed* and *cried*, but didn't necessarily *cry* first before *laughing*, or *laugh* first before *crying* | Describes multiple events one after the other with a logical relationship<br/>I.e. I *looked at him* first before *weeping*, which is a direct consequence of me *looking at him* | Describes multiple events one after the other without a clear logical relationship<br/>I.e. I *slept* before I *ate*, but *eating* is not a necessary consequence of me *sleeping* |

While in English all three categories are expressed by the same word 'and', in Shryan there is a separate ending for each. 



#### Logical Extenders <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>NEW</sup></a> <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>VIP</sup></a>

In Shryan, there are 4 types of logical extenders you can add on to any word, but primarily conjunctions and relative pronouns. We have already met *consequential* and *inconsequential temporal*. Here we will introduce two more categories: *consequential relational* and *alternative relational*.

**Consequential relational**: expresses a logical link between two clauses. Add ***-(i)ti***.

E.g. 'I was hurt by a pin which is sharp.' -> here 'which is sharp' does not just provide extra information regarding the properties of the pin; it also provides a likely reason for why I was hurt.

**Alternative relational**: expresses an alternative relationship between two clauses. Add ***-(i)ta***.

E.g. 'I hate these weapons, these mechanisms of death.' -> here 'weapons' and 'mechanisms of death' are referring to the same thing, just from a different viewpoint.

**Consequential temporal**: expresses a logical and temporal link between two clauses. Add ***-(o)toi***.

**Inconsequential temporal**: expresses a temporal link between two clauses only. Add ***-(o)to***.



#### Other logical conjunctions

|    Logic     | Meaning        |  Shryan   |
| :----------: | :------------- | :-------: |
| Inclusive OR | And/Or         | ***lod*** |
| Exclusive OR | Or but not and | ***do***  |
|     Not      | Not            | ***co***  |



### Dealing with Ambiguities <a style='color: red; font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;'><sup>VIP</sup></a>

#### Nesting sentence structures

Oftentimes you may want to make a distinction between various sentence elements that you join together. Consider the ambiguity in the English sentences below:

1. 'I like old songs and movies.'

   In this sentence, depending on how you break up the sentence, (I like; old songs; and movies *vs* I like; old songs and movies) it's not exactly clear whether old is an adjective of both 'songs and movies', or just 'songs'. 

   In Shryan this is resolved by adding a ***-se*** to the end of ***lo*** for components that 'stick' together. Compare:

   ***Oga cero jhevei gontus lo tsuvams***: I like; old songs; and movies. (old only governs songs)

   *vs*

   ***Oga cero jhevei gontus lose tsuvams***: I like; old songs and movies. (old governs both)

2. 'I enjoy Taylor Swift and the Beatles who are famous.

   Use ***lose*** to say that 'Taylor Swift and the Beatles' are famous; use ***lo*** to say that only the Beatles are famous

In fact, the ***-se*** suffix can be added onto any word to 'stick' things together. Such suffixes are called 'sticky extenders'. If you want to next multiple levels together (e.g. I dislike the ((principles of love and hatred) and laws of crime) which are harsh), here is a table listing the sticky extenders as you go deeper down.

| Level | Stick extender |
| :---: | :------------: |
|   1   |   ***-se***    |
|   2   |  ***-sequ***   |
|   3   |  ***-sequi***  |
|   4   |  ***-sero***   |
