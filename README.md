# Shryan

<a style="color: cornflowerblue;">Shryan is not a language. It is an <i>abstraction of thought.</i> </a>

<a style="color: olive;">Shryan is a portmanteau of *shrei* and *yanre*, which means *intelligent words* in Shryan.</a>

## Guiding Thoughts

In an era where information is increasingly the powerhouse of the world, ironically information is harder to communicate across than ever. Great specialization in today's society means that a lot of what we know is complicated; but complex ideas are often synonymous to long passages of convoluted text. This renders communication of these ideas slow and difficult.

Our society has recognized this problem and responded in two ways: training people to express themselves better and training people to learn quickly. The former gives the skill to convey abstractions with clarity, while the latter builds the intelligence to comprehend and absorb them well.

However, perhaps there is a part to the communication process which is often overlooked (and maybe rightfully so) - the language itself. Offhand, inventing a new language for better communication sounds like a long detour that isn't guaranteed to work. Not only does a new language take a lot of time to learn, but also who is to say that this novel language will be inherently better at communicating human ideas than anything which we already have and tested?

If you did take a second to let that last sentence sink in - congratulations! You have discovered that English is surprisingly bad at delivering complex sentences. Notice that when we think, however, even convoluted ideas seem to be represented in a simple manner. 

Therefore, the following are the natural guiding questions behind Shryan's creation:

<div width="100%" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Can we inject the simplicity of thought into a language?</div>

<div width="100%" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Can a language be not only powerful, but also lightweight and easy to learn?</div>

<div width="100%" style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">How can we condense information in a language, while still maintaining interpretability?</div>
